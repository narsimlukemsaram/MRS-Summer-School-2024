# MRS-Summer-School-2024
The 2024 Multi-Robot Systems (MRS) Summer School took place at the Czech Technical University (CTU) in Prague, Czech Republic, from July 29 to August 2, 2024. The event includes lectures, seminars, hands-on sessions, and social activities.

We participated in both the simulation and real-world challenges. It was a great experience!
